This repo contains the source code for the MK-AllChat website which I created using React.

This is a Website made for chatting with your Friends and Loved Ones.
This website was made by Mohit Kumar using REACT JS. Also, It uses FIREBASE for Backend Connectivity and Authentication.
It impliments the idea of Zero Privacy. Hence, all your Chats will be Public.
Also, Special thanks to CleverProgrammer for the tutorials.

Since it's a web based Chatting App, it will be best viewed in Bigger Screens.
Enjoy!

Also This Website is Hosted on Netlify,

Look for the File named : HOSTEDLINK.txt in the root directory.

The WEBSITE IS HOSTED on NETLIFY
